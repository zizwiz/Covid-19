Covid-19 Stats Help.

 

I started this app during National “Lockdown 1” in March 2020 as a way of me being able to get some stats all in one place. At that stage getting any reliable stats was difficult as we had been hit by a pandemic for which we had no experience of what to do. After a while of using various stats, I settled on getting the stats from " United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Humanitarian Data Exchange" 

As the pandemic got more under control the app took a back seat. When the vaccines were announced I started to wonder how to get stats from them again into one place where I could see every day how we were doing. In Dec 2020 I came across "Our World in Data" who were gathering data and allowed people access to it via GitHub. 

I also found some extra interesting data at "WHO coronavirus disease (COVID-19) dashboard" and I include this as a way of cross-checking figures.  

When I started the app, I had no idea of where it would go so as I went along, I designed it organically and at times took easy paths to make it work. That means the code is not as efficient as it could be. Again thanks to “stackoverflow” for just being there as a reference which at times saved me hours of coding.

When you first start the app, it needs to go out to the world and fetch the latest data which it brings back and displays. If this is the first time you run the app then it will take a short while depending on your internet connection speed.

It is always difficult to compare stats from different countries as you do not know if the info is collected the same. Some countries have larger populations than others so stats looked at one way may favour a large country but looking at it another way may favour the smaller country. For that reason, most columns in the app allow sorting either Ascending or Descending.  
During the development I have found times when the structure of the data I am fetching changes and the app no longer works properly in certain areas. As soon as I find this, I change the app to make it work again but there is not harm in letting me know it does not work or if you think there are items, I should add to the App.
Who World Stats
This Tab shows the total Cases and deaths of the population. Deaths and cases are not always measured the same way, so this is only a good indication of what is the reality. If you want to line your countries Deaths and Cases, then find your country in the drop-down menu and click on find.  

    
Country Cases and Deaths

 

Here you can choose your country and see the daily totals for Deaths and Cases. If you click on Draw graphs then you will see 4 graphs.

Daily confirmed cases by Testing	Hospital Deaths
 	 
	
Cases per 100k of population	Deaths per 100k of population
 	 

Click Update to get the latest data from the internet.

UK Vaccinations
This is more daily UK focusing but does also show cumulative stats for the whole world. Once inside the TAB there are lots more country and area tabs to click and see more data. Press Update Data to get the latest data from the internet

 

Clicking on Graphs will bring up a few graphs that may be of interest.

 

In the piecharts we can see on the left a chart showing in green the % of world population convered. Red indicates the unvaccinated population. 

The centre pie (stacked doughnut) chart shows in the outer ring in green The % UK population covered with 1st vaccination and in the inner ring the % fully covered. Some vaccines need 1 dose, some 2 and some 3. In UK so far all vaccines used in UK need 2 doses.

The righthand pie and the right panel show the Local UK campaning if there is one active. The one shown above is to vaccinate 14 million people by 14 Feb 2021. When it is on target the background will turn green and when it falls behind it will be red. The pie chart shows how far from the target we are in % terms. The green shows the amount done while red is amount still to go.

The 4 graphs show each devolved nation in the UK and how they are getting on. I tried to have them in one graph but each country changes the way they let us have the data and after fixing it many times it is easier to show 4 graphs. I also found that the UK has a much larger population than the rest combined that when you add them to the same graph you can only make any sense of England. When reading them do check the Y scale which indicates the number vaccinated.  


World Vac Unverified
This shows as much details as I can find on each country regraind numbers but also the vaccines the use and a clickable link to where the data comes from. If the country you want is not in the drop down then they either have not started vaccinating or do not provide data. Getting data is not easy and getting reliable data even more so. This is why this is called unverified data.

When new coutries are available you will see them when you click update data. The updating can take a short while as there are many files I need to build.

 

At the bottom of the drop down list you will see the “World”. Here you get a list of all the coutries and territories sorted by % covered with 1st vac. 

 

If you then sort via 1st Vac Total by clicking on its header you will see the list sorted by the  actual numbers of people vaccinated. This makes a bit more sense to me as small populations can quickly get a higher % covered than a large population.
